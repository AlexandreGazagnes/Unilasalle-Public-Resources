#### 1.1.2 Data as a Source of Power and Wealth

- **Data → Insight → Decision → Value**:
   - Analyze situations and options.
   - Make informed decisions.
   - Drive actions that generate power and wealth.

   ---

- **The Double-Edged Sword**:
   - Wrong data can lead to successful outcomes by luck.
   - Good data and analysis might fail due to unforeseen circumstances.

## 1.2 Misinterpretations of Data

#### 1.2.1 WWII Plane Armor

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="image-7.png" alt="WWII Plane Armor" style="max-width: 80%;">

---
<br>
<br>
<br>

- Observing bullet holes on returning planes led to the assumption armor should be placed there.

- **The Insight**: Focus on parts where planes didn’t sustain damage but were still crucial to survival—the non-returned planes provided key missing data.

---

#### 1.2.2 Being Fooled by Data:
- Common cognitive biases:
   - **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking data that confirms existing beliefs.
   - **Availability Heuristic**: Overvaluing easily accessible information.
   - **Survivorship Bias**: Focusing on successful outcomes while ignoring failures.
   - **Loss Aversion**: Overvaluing potential losses over gains.
   - **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Justifying continued investment in a failing endeavor.
   - **Anchoring**: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information.

- Other hidden variables include gender, socioeconomic status, and education. -->

## 2. Not so Basic Reminder about Not so Basic Data Analysis

---

### 2.1 Data is not about mean, IQ or stat test?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

No  
No  
No  
No

</div>

---

<br>

**Data → Insight → Decision → Value**  

<br>

Think in reverse:

- What is my purpose?
  - Optimizing **n**, finding solutions.
  - Business, money, medical goals.

- What is my problem?
- **What do I know about my problem?**

---

### 2.2 Getting Some Relevant Data

<br>
<br>

- What data might/should I want?
- Where to find it?
- What variables could I find (internet/open data/in my company)?
- Is it relevant? Too old? Too many? Trustable? Related?

---


### 2.3 Being Critical with Data

- How many variables are there?
- Can I trust them?

<br>

Examples:
- User database: someone listed as 198 years old?
- Many users 1750m tall? (Maybe data is in cm?)
- dataset with 95% of missing values?

---

### 2.4 First Look at the Data

#### 2.4.1 Reading the Data

- **Display the Data**:
  - Top 10 rows
  - Last 10 rows
  - Random 10 rows

- **Shape of the Data**
---

<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

  **Take the time to look at the data**

<br>
<br>

  **Let your brain make some inferences (it’s pretty good at this)**

</div>

---

#### 2.4.2 Data Types and First Insights

- **Data Types**:
  - Numerical:
    - Continuous
    - Discrete

  - Categorical:
    - Ordinal
    - Cardinal

**Tip**: Convert ordinal categorical data to numerical if needed.

---


### 2.5 Missing Values and Outliers

- **Identify Missing Values**:
  - Count NaN values.
  - Missing values (%) by row/column.

- **Examine Outliers**:
  - Min / Max values.
  - Use summary stats and visualizations:
    - Mean / Standard Deviation / Density Function
    - Median / IQR / Box Plots

---

### 2.6 Preparing / cleaning the data

* Drop columns / lines with too many missing values
* Select subset of columns / lines with relevant data for  your analysis
* Fill missing values with mean, median, mode, or other values if relevant
* Transform categorical ordinal data into numerical data if relevant
* Apply log, square root, or other transformations to numerical data if relevant
* Remove outliers if relevant
* Create new columns if relevant

--- 

### 2.7 Univariate Analysis

### 2.8.2 Multi variate analysis

Correlation matrix : 
* Heatmap
* Scatter plot matrix

Question to ask :

- What are the most correlated variables ?
- What does that mean to  have 2 variables very highly correlated ?
- What not so easy to interpret variables do  we have ?

---

## 3. Grouping Data & dimensions

--- 

### 3.1 Curse of dimentionality


In data : 
* More columns = more data = more information
* More columns = more data = more noise

**The more columns you have, the more difficult it is to find the signal in the noise**

Data selection is key to avoid the curse of dimentionality

--- 

Having 100 or 1000 columns is a garantee of having a good dataset ! 

<br>
<br>

## 3.2 Main ideas behind Grouping Data & dimensions


1. **Reduces Complexity**

    High-dimensional data can be difficult to analyze due to the "curse of dimensionality." Reducing dimensions simplifies data, making it easier to understand and process.

2. **Enhances Visualization**

    Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE reduce data to 2D or 3D, enabling visualization of complex datasets.

---

3. **Facilitates Interpretability** 

    A dataset with fewer dimensions is easier to interpret and analyze. It highlights the most important variables contributing to the underlying patterns.

3. **Improves Performance**

    Algorithms like clustering, regression, or classification perform faster on lower-dimensional data. Computational efficiency increases, especially for machine learning models.

--- 


<br>


**Grouping Data & dimensions  : 2 main techniques** 

<br>

- Reducing the number of columns ==> ACP /PCA : Principal Component Analysis

<br>

- Reducing the number of lines  ==> clustering : K-means / DBSCAN / Hierarchical clustering

---

### Grouping the columns with Principal Component Analysis 


- **ACP /PCA : Principal Component Analysis**

    - **Goal**: Reduce the number of dimensions while retaining the most important information.
    - **Method**: Linear transformation to create new uncorrelated variables (principal components).
    - **Applications**: Data visualization, noise reduction, feature extraction, and data compression.

--- 

**Process** 

* Prepare the  data by  standardizing it.
* Computing Explain variance ratio.
* Selecting the number of components.
* Computing new synthetic variables.
* Interpreting the new synthetic variables.
* Transforming the data.
* Projetcion of the  data in the new synthetic variables.
* Analysing the results.

### Grouping the lines with clustering : K-Means

- **K-means** 

    - **Goal** : Group data points into clusters based on similarity, minimizing the variance within each cluster.
    
    - **Method** : Iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates centroids to minimize within-cluster variance.
    
    - **Applications** : Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and document clustering.


--- 

**Process**

* Prepare the data by normalizing or scaling it.
* Choose the number of clusters (k) based on prior knowledge or methods like the Elbow Method.
* Initialize the centroids randomly or using optimized techniques.
* Assign data points to the nearest centroid using a distance metric.
* Process data until convergence (when centroids no longer change significantly).
* Analyze the results:   Evaluate cluster quality, Plot, Interpret clusters in the context of the problem domain.
