## 1. Objectives 

The objective of this exam is to evaluate your ability to analyze a dataset, to extract insights, to make decisions and to communicate your results.

A dedicated focus will be made on the analysis, the visualisation and the implementation of a PCA / Clustering.

--- 


## 2. Context


<br>


* Oral  presentation on April the 8th, 2025

* Group of 5 students : 

    - 15 min of presentation
    - 5 min of Q&A

---

## 3. Timeline

<br>

To remember :

-  AT LEAST - March 20th --> Sending your group description by email
-  AT LEAST - March 24th --> Sending the dataset for validation
-  AT LEAST - April 2nd  --> Sending the pre-release of your notebook for validation
-  AT LEAST - April 7th  --> Sending the final version of your notebook for validation - powerpoint presentation

## 4. Modailities 

### 4.1 About the Data

You should 1st : 
* Find a dataset on the  internet. Feel free to use Kaggle, UCI, etc
    * The dataset should be in CSV format
    * The dataset should contain at least 1000 rows and 10 columns
    * No same dataset for all students, first come first served ! 


---

### 4.2 About the mindset

Then you should :

* Find 
    * a problem to solve with this dataset

    * Questions to answer

    * Analysis to perform 


--- 

### 4.3 About the analysis

Then you should :

- Evaluate the quality of the data
- Clean the data if needed
- Prepare the data for analysis
- Perform the analysis
- Visualize the data
- Implement a PCA and/or a clustering

---

## 5. Guidances 1/3 

- Powerpoint presentation  : 
     - From 10 to 20 slides
     - Structured approach
     - Plan :        
        - 1/ Context/Intro 
        - 2/ Data, preparation, cleaning etc 
        - 3/ Insights, analysis, visualisation, Tests
        - Conclusion, recommendations, go further 

---


## 5. Guidances 2/3

<br>

Jupyter / Google Colab notebook :
 - Clean, structured, commented
 - You can use Colab, plain code, Jupyter notebook etc
 - 1 notebook is expected BUT feel free to add more if needed
 - Feel free to use external libraries, packages, etc
 - Calm down with GenAI, it's very easy to find out if the job is done by a machine or a human ;) 

--- 

## 5. Guidances 3/3


 - Your code MUST BE reproducible ! 

    - I should be able to run your code and get the same results as you
    - I should be able to understand your code
    - I should be able to reproduce your analysis
    
- If not : 
    - Your work **will not be evaluated**

---

## 6. Evaluation 1/2 

<br>

10 points will be given for the quality of the analysis, the insights, the visualisation, the implementation of the PCA and/or the clustering. 

More precisely, 2 points will be given for each of these items : 

- Data exploration 
- Data preparation and cleaning 
- Analysis and insights 
- PCA AND/OR Clustering 

---

## 6. Evaluation 2/2

<br>

5 points will be given for the quality of the presentation, the structure, the clarity, the recommendations, the go further etc

5 points will be given for the questions and the answers during the Q&A.
