# Data Analysis - Exam.


Welcome to the exam of the course Data Analysis! 


## About

You will find in this repository the following files:

- ```README.md```: (this file) a markdown file containing the description of the repository, and losts of usefull information to help you for this exam.

- ```0502-Data_Analytics_With_Python_examination.ipynb```: a jupyter notebook containing the exam. **THIS FILE WILL BE UPLOADED on 2024-04-15 at 7am**. That is the file you will have to download, use and send back fully completed at the end of your exam.

- ```0502-Data_Analytics_With_Python_test.ipynb``` : a jupyter notebook you can download, jus as a warm up, to be sure that you will be able to load the notebook, the external libraries and the dataset. ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are not able to run this notebook, you have to worry about your exam !  

- iris_example.csv: a csv file containing the data used in the exam.



## What you should do - BEFORE - the exam. 

1. Install on your local laptop/UniLasalle's computer ```Anaconda``` or ``` Jupyter notebook``` (Anaconda is better than Jupyter) OR be sure you are able to use ```google colab```. 

For most advanced users, you can use your own IDE (like PyCharm, VSCode, etc.), but be sure you are able to use the packages listed below. 

If you are experiencing any issues, you will find lots of ressources in the notebook of the 1st session, including external videos and tutorials, and including decicated videos I have uploaded on youtube just for you.


2. Be sure that you are able to use the following packages:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - plotly
    - scikit-learn

Please use the ```0502-Data_Analytics_With_Python_test.ipynb``` notebook to be sure that everything is fine for you **BEFORE** the exam.

For instance, if the command `import pandas as pd` is working, you are good to go. If not, you should install the package using the command `!pip install pandas` in a cell of your jupyter notebook or in the terminal of your IDE.

3. Feel free to download the data and take a look at it. Please to the same for the ```0502-Data_Analytics_With_Python_test.ipynb``` file.

4. Spend some time reading all the online material you will find on this repository. Keep in mind that a good understanding of what, why and how do prevails on your code's expertise. 

5. Sleep early to have maximum intellectual resources on the big day üòâ.



## What you should do - DURING - the exam. 

1. Take a big breath and, as we say in the The [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy): Don't Panic.

2. Go on this web page, download the ```0502-Data_Analytics_With_Python_examination.ipynb``` notebook.

3. Load this notebook on your personnal laptop with Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab or your favorite IDE (pyCharm, VScode etc...).

4. Read carefully the ```About``` section. 

5. Go threw the notebook, fill empty lines of code and comment lines.

6. Save, and download, if needed the last and good version of your notebook, and send the ```*.ipynb``` version of the document to you teacher ```Paul.LANTHIER@unilasalle.fr```
